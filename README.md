# React Jam 23 Project

The React Jam this year has begun!  The theme this year is cooperation.

Egg and I were thinking about making an Idler/Clicker since its something we both waste a lot of time on. I'm gonna enhance that idea and turn it into a cooperative idler! I'm thinking for every user playing in your world you get a bonus to income and can all contribute to a world pool of resources to build up your income and make number go up!
